# Travelbee
Travelbee is a travel package providing company's website. This is my first proper deployable website. But gh doesn't support server side code so, alas!
So this index.html file is not exactly a part of my project, I didn't know that github only supports static codes, so I tried the conventional way to get rid of 404 
error but as a fact of gh being a static website hosting platform, my wensite isn't visible. But I'm not deleting the index file, I'm writing this for me to remember 
what I did years ago.
Only the TRAVELBEE folder is my project which would work with XAMPP, only we would need to configure the DB named book_db with 9 columns as in the register page
of my project, with datatypes being int, varchar and date accordingly.
